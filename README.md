**Abstract:**
This code is for a car black box system, designed to manage and display various vehicle events, including time, speed, gear changes, and event logs. The system integrates multiple peripherals, such as an LCD display, an RTC (Real-Time Clock), an EEPROM for data storage, and a keypad for user interaction. The main functionalities of the system include storing event data (such as time, gear states, and speed) in EEPROM, viewing and downloading logs, setting the system time, and clearing logs.

**Key components and their functions:**

**Event Logging:**
Events are stored in the EEPROM, with each event containing data such as the time (from the DS1307 RTC), gear state, and vehicle speed (calculated from ADC values).
The system ensures that a maximum of 100 events are logged, and older events are overwritten when the storage limit is reached.

**Menu System:**
The system supports a menu with four options: "VIEW LOG," "SET TIME," "DOWNLOAD LOG," and "CLEAR LOG."
The user navigates the menu using a matrix keypad and can select an option to interact with the system. When an option is selected, the corresponding function (viewing, setting time, downloading, or clearing logs) is executed.

**Time Management:**
The current time is obtained from the DS1307 RTC and displayed in a HH:MM:SS format.
The system allows users to modify the time via the keypad, with the option to increment hours, minutes, or seconds. The time is saved to the DS1307 RTC when the user exits the time-setting mode.

**Log Viewing and Downloading:**
The user can view the stored event logs on the LCD display, navigating through the logs with the keypad.
The logs are displayed in a formatted manner with time, gear state, and speed information.
The logs can also be downloaded via UART to an external device for further use.

**Clear Log:**
The system includes a "CLEAR LOG" function that clears all stored events in the EEPROM, resetting the log count and freeing up space for new events.

**Speed Calculation:**
The speed of the vehicle is calculated based on ADC readings from a designated channel. The ADC value is divided by a constant to convert it into a speed value, which is then displayed and logged.

The code is structured to allow easy navigation through the menu, interaction with the RTC and EEPROM, and presentation of data on the LCD. The overall goal is to provide a comprehensive and reliable system for tracking and storing vehicle events, similar to a "black box" in an automobile.
